/*
Container is the top-level object for one or more metric.

If a Template is provided, it will used as the initial value for each of
the metrics - this is expanded by the transformers.Template transformers,
and internal code does not need to worry about this.

A single Container instance is typically the result of a single POST to the
HTTP receiver or similar.

/*
Metric is a collection of measurements related to the same metadata and
point in time.

A good example of a single metric is port statistics for a single interface
on a router.

Both Metadata and Data is proided. The difference is generally in how data
is accessed. Metadata is data you will search for - e.g. the name of the
router, the name of the interface, etc. It is also possible to add more
dynamic data as metadata, such as OS versions, but exactly how this will be
handled will be up to underlying storage engines. E.g.: for influxdb, anything
in metadata will be an (indexed) tag, so having reasonably rich metadata is
perfectly fine, but you may want to keep an eye on the granularity.

A simple rule of thumb:

Metadata is what you search with.

Data is what you search for.

Example:

	{
		"time": "2019-03-25T12:00:00Z",
		"metadata": {
			"device": "routera",
			"os": "JUNOS 15.4R1",
			"chassisId": "something"
		},
		"data": {
			"uptime": 124125124,
			"cputemp": 22
		}
	}

It is possible to have nested data, however, it is NOT a requirement
that a sender accepts this. And in general, it is better to "flatten"
out data into multiple metrics instead. This can be done with a
(custom) transformer.

Example of a nested structure:

	{
		"time": "2019-03-25T12:00:00Z",
		"metadata": {
			"device": "routera",
			"os": "JUNOS 15.4R1",
			"chassisId": "something"
		},
		"data": {
			"ports": {
				"ge-0/0/0": {
					"ifHCInOctets":  5,
					"ifHCOutOctets": 10
				},
				"ge-0/0/1": {
					"ifHCInOctets":  2,
					"ifHCOutOctets": 20
				}
			}
		}
	}

This is legal, but it's probably wise to use a transformer to change it into:

	{
		"time": "2019-03-25T12:00:00Z",
		"metadata": {
			"device": "routera",
			"os": "JUNOS 15.4R1",
			"chassisId": "something",
			"port": "ge-0/0/0"
		},
		"data": {
			"ifHCInOctets":  5,
			"ifHCOutOctets": 10
			}
		}
	},
	{
		"time": "2019-03-25T12:00:00Z",
		"metadata": {
			"device": "routera",
			"os": "JUNOS 15.4R1",
			"chassisId": "something",
			"port": "ge-0/0/1"
		},
		"data": {
			"ifHCInOctets":  2,
			"ifHCOutOctets": 20
			}
		}
	}
