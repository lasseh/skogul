TCPLine listens on a IP:TCP port specified in the Address string and accepts
one container per line to be sent to the parser.

Example usage, assuming JSON parser:

	$ cat payloads/simple.json  | jq -c . | nc '::1' '1234'

Since this is not possible to secure, it should be avoided where possible and
placed as close to the data source. A good use of this model is to use a TCPLine
receiver on the same box that needs to write to it, combined with
skogul.senders.HTTP to forward over a more sensible channel.
