This directory is used to manage machine-generated code, presently only the
stuff shipped for Juniper's Streaming Telmetry interface, which is based on
Google Protocol buffers.

The protocol interfaces are released under an Apache 2 license, and we
include a tar-ball of it here for pure convenience.
